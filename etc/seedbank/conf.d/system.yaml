# firmwares     -> recent Debian releases do not include support for 
#                  proprietary firmwares, seedBank manage will automatically

# template files which are in the templates path
# (default: /etc/seedbank/templates)
#
# puppet_manifest    -> this tem[late is used for generating scripts in the /etc/runonce.d directort which

# pxe_default        -> the default file in the pxelinux.cfg directory, this file describes the actions
#                       which should be done when no machine specific pxelinux.cfg file is found
# pxe_debian         -> this template will be used for generating a node pxelinux.cfg file when a Debian
#                       machine will be enabled for installation by the 'seedbank net command'
# pxe_ubuntu         -> this template will be used for generating a node pxelinux.cfg file when an Ubuntu
#                       machine will be enabled for installation by the 'seedbank net command'
# isolinux           -> this template will replace the default isolinux.cfg file on an installation ISO
# rc_local           -> this template constructs a temporary initrd file which will run once and run
#                       by default the scripts in the /etc/runonce.d directory, and after it is done it
#                       will run the 'orginal' initrd script and replace itself with the 'original'
#                       initrd script
# permission_script  -> from this template the 'permission script' will be generated based on
#                       'permissions' files in the overlay directory which could be generated
#                       by the 'seedbank manage command'
