# seedBank example configuration created by Jasper Poppe <jpoppe@ebay.com>

# enable and disable hooks which contain command(s) which will be executed on
# the host you are running seedBank from. When running seedBank to generate
# a pxelinux.cfg file the command(s) specified in the enable hook will be
# executed. The command(s) specified in the disable hook will be executed by the
# seedBank daemon when the installation has finished and just before the system
# restarts
#
# enable  -> those command(s) will run after a system has been enabled for
#            installation by the 'seedbank pxe' command
# disable -> those command(s) will run after an installation is done and
#            the machine will notify the seedBank daemon by requesting
#            the disable url
